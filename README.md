What is Tugboat?
----------------

Tugboat is a tool to generate Airship site manifest files from an excel
based engineering spec. The tool accepts Excel sheet and corresponding
excel specification as inputs and generates the site level manifests. As
an optional step it can generate an intermediary yaml which contain all
the information that will be rendered to generate Airship site manifests.
This optional step will help the deployment engineer to modify any data
if required.

    export WORKSPACE=<dir where excelspecs are placed>
    export IMAGE=<docker_image>
    tugboat/tools/tugboat.sh <command> <options>
